  Welcome to ByeGCSE! Last May, we finished our IGCSE exams. Good riddance. We
  never liked them, they were horribly tiring, and they were terrible at testing
  the core subject abilities they were designed to test. We had to work hard to
  shift our understanding into the little checkboxes in the IGCSE mark scheme
  and we want to make it easier for you lucky lot.

title: Who We Are

Welcome to ByeGCSE! Last May, we finished our IGCSE exams (sort of, it was complicated with COVID-19). Good riddance. We never liked them, they were horribly tiring, and we had to learn secret tricks and techniques the hard way. We had to work hard to shift our understanding into the little checkboxes in the IGCSE mark scheme and we want to make it easier for you lucky lot. 

Here’s the secret- to prepare for IGCSE exams, you need knowledge, skill, AND secret technique. There are these subtle little tricks that get you marks on the exam paper that teachers never tell you about. Teachers don’t tell you what you need to get the marks not because they’re bad or evil, but because they want you to actually learn instead of focusing on the marks. Lucky for you, we’re not teachers, and we will disclose to you all the hidden secrets we learnt over the 2 years we studied IGCSEs.
