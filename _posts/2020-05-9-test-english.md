The **ExxonMobil climate change controversy** concerns
[ExxonMobil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil)'s activities related to
[global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming), especially their
opposition to established climate science. Since the 1970s, ExxonMobil engaged
in climate research, and later began
[lobbying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuels_lobby), advertising, and
grant making, some of which were conducted with the purpose of delaying
widespread acceptance and [action on global
warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_on_global_warming).

From the late 1970s and through the 1980s,
[Exxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon) funded internal and university
collaborations, broadly in line with the developing public scientific approach.
From the 1980s to mid 2000s, the company was a leader in [climate change
denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial), opposing
[regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegated_legislation) to curtail
global warming. ExxonMobil funded organizations critical of the [Kyoto
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) and sought to undermine
[public opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion_on_climate_change)
about the scientific consensus that [global
warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming) is caused by the burning
of [fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel). Exxon helped to
found and lead the [Global Climate
Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Climate_Coalition) of businesses
opposed to the regulation of [greenhouse
gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) emissions. More recently it
has expressed support for a [carbon
tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax) and the [Paris
agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_agreement).
