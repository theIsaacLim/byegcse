title: Easy A* in IGCSE Lit 4- Memorizing a Perfect IGCSE Literature Seen Essay
---

*In this five part series, I'm going to show you how to ace your Cambridge IGCSE
World Literature Course, taking you through everything teachers don't show you.
I promise you that IGCSE English is a course with incredibly limited scope, and
it's easy to manipulate this to your advantage and score high marks with ease.
It always tackles the same themes, looks for the same things in your writings,
and it's acknowledging this will help you.*

*So far, we've taken a look at the Unseen Paper. This article will explain how
to approach the Seen Paper in a way that guarantees success.*

The structure of this revision technique is inspired by a Youtube series by
Cambridge medical student Ali Abdaal. He runs through a method he used for
memorising neuroscience in medical school, and although it's not perfectly
applicable to the relatively minuscule task of IGCSE English, we think it's
still relevant. I've simplified and modified this technique to be specifically
applicable to iGCSE, and this new is the basis of this post. Hereâ€™s a link to
that: [Ali Abdaal's Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/-46Vyiwat_Y?t=507)

This post is the second half of a two parter on the IGCSE Literature Seen Essay,
which in turn is part of a greater series on smashing IGCSE Lit as a whole. I'd
recommend reading the first article before this one, although that's not
necessary.

2a. Active Recall: Anki Flashcards
==================================

Anki is a flashcard app designed by medical students(they're geniuses) to help
with memorisation through active recall and space repetition. If you're revising
at all, you're likely already do this in some form.

-   A**ctive recall** refers to when active effort is put into
    remembering(recalling) anything

    -   For instance, every time you try to guess the back of a flashcard, or
        every time you conjure up an equation for maths, that's active recall

-   **Spaced repetition** is drilling concepts into your head through repeated
    practice spread out across time

    -   Maybe you test your Physics equations once a week or so. Maybe you
        revise your verb conjugations every day. This sort of repetition, over
        time, is known as spaced repetition

How Anki is different from most flashcards app is its minute, science-based
protocol which has been shown
[time](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331702172_Using_Anki_A_computer-based_flashcard_program_in_improving_vocabulary_in_the_second_grade_students_of_SMP_Negeri_6_Makassar)
and [time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031794/) again to be
effective in helping students memorise. Here's what makes Anki better:

-   It spaces out when you see certain cards depending on how strong you feel at
    them, instead of just drilling you on each one equally. Thus, it prioritises
    the topic areas that are the hardest for you, rather than equally
    distributing your practice

    -   This is the key-it might seem tiny, but this is the **key features**
        that makes Anki work

-   It allows for a lot more malleability than other flashcard apps. There are
    lots of different card types that can all come into play

-   It's a lot more customisable, allowing for templates and themes and etc

Here's how to use Anki in combination with the Seen Essay writing strategy from
the previous article

-   Memorise blocks from every single essay you have written

    -   This is described briefly in Abdaal's video, but the idea is you write
        down the key points of each essay in the back of your Anki flashcards,
        and you write down an identifying keyword on the front

    -   The idea behind this is to get the main blocks of the most common essays
        that might occur in an exam memorised

        -   Even if a unanticipated essay comes up on an exam, you will still be
            able to include blocks of knowledge that you have already studied on
            it

-   Make sure you always do Anki

    -   If you log onto Anki and practice on a daily basis, there is a really
        high chance the information you receive will be fully absorbed into your
        brain

    -   You have to build a habit of going onto Anki, or it won't be nearly as
        effective

-   Include quotes in your Anki flashcards

    -   So you're not just memorising the points that you might make, but also
        the quotes themselves

2b. Spider Diagrams
===================

Spider Diagrams are a brilliant way to practice essay writing strategies in a
short amount of time. You're not writing a full essay, instead sort of imagining
what you would say in an exam scenario, thus getting a lot of value from your
time.

-   Plan spider diagrams for every single essay that could possibly come up

    -   Get questions from past papers, and then plot out a response on spider
        diagrams, utlising the blocks of essays you've memorised already to
        compose a response

-   I've listed tips on how to prepare essays in the last article, and I'd
    recommend using that as a guide to this.
