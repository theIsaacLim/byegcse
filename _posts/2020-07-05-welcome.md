Today, on the 5th of July, 2020, ByeGCSE, one of the only by-students
for-students IGCSE revision platforms on the web, opens. We're a free IGCSE
revision platform that provides big blog content, but also tailored individual
help through our Discord, created by students, for students. We didn't want to
waste the many hours we spent revising and finding secret techniques to score
points on the IGCSE, so we made it public, for everyone to see.

Here's what we provide:

-   A one-of-a-kind Discord server where you can ask for revision help and get
    it from fellow students and older peer mentors

-   Exclusive blog posts that detail the little techniques we learnt would help
    you with your IGCSE. Currently, we have posts up for English Lit and
    Biology, but we're planning on expanding to all three sciences and Computer
    Science(stay tuned!)

So bookmark us, join our Discord, and follow along if you want to hear our
secret methods for acing the IGCSE.
